          <br /><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong><br />

          <br />I am excited to pursue opportunities in system administration, leveraging my strong background in IT infrastructure, hands-on data center experience, and a clear path toward cloud administration. I am eager to bring my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to a dynamic and innovative team.<br />

          <br />As a Senior Data Center Technician at Providence Health, I have honed my <em>skills in deploying and configuring servers, troubleshooting hardware issues, and utilizing DCIM tools such as EcoStruxure for infrastructure management.</em> My experience upgrading network infrastructure from copper to fiber has directly improved operational efficiency by enhancing data speeds from 1Gbps to 10Gbps. Additionally, my tenure at Microsoft as a Systems Engineer allowed me to manage server deployments, track IT assets, and collaborate with internal teams to resolve break/fix issues using ServiceNow and ICM.<br />

          <br />My technical proficiency includes <em>Active Directory, AWS, Linux (RedHat, Ubuntu), Windows Server, and scripting languages such as Bash and PowerShell.</em> I hold <em>industry certifications including CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, AWS Cloud Practitioner, and LPI Linux Essentials,</em> demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and professional development. Currently pursuing a B.S. in Cloud Computing at Western Governors University, I am dedicated to expanding my expertise in system and cloud administration.<br />

          <br />I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to a forward-thinking organization. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my expertise aligns with the needs of your team and would appreciate the chance for an interview at your earliest convenience.<br />

          <br />Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to connecting.<br />

          <br /><mark>Best regards,</mark><br />
          Reid A. Wheeler
